# server.swift

A simple server for serving static files and testing HTTP requests powered by [Vapor](https://vapor.codes) and [swift sh](https://github.com/mxcl/swift-sh).

## Usage

#### Install swift sh
```console
brew install mxcl/made/swift-sh
```

> More instructions for `swift sh` are available at [https://github.com/mxcl/swift-sh/](https://github.com/mxcl/swift-sh/).

#### Run server.swift
```console
swift sh <(curl -L https://github.com/cak/server.swift/raw/master/server.swift)
```

```console
Server starting on http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

*Alternatively, you can clone the repository and run `â€Œswift sh server.swift`*

## Serving Static Files
servers.swift will serve all files in the current working directory. 

## Examples

### GET request:

```console
curl -i "http://localhost:8000/get?foo=bar" \
     -H 'origin: https://serversideswift.dev'
```

**server.swift console**

```console
GET request to /get?foo=bar from 127.0.0.1
{
  "path" : "\/get?foo=bar",
  "method" : "GET",
  "headers" : {
    "User-Agent" : "curl\/7.54.0",
    "Host" : "localhost:8000",
    "origin" : "https:\/\/serversideswift.dev",
    "Accept" : "*\/*"
  },
  "origin" : "127.0.0.1"
}
```
